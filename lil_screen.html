    I have been into web designing since my class 8th i.e, since 2016, and have been working with the raspberry pi since 2018.
    I have participated in a few competitions as well like the Race-O-Bots and also made a hacking car for model making competition
    which was later displayed in a school exhibition as well.A few of my projects which are publicly available are on my github.<br> <br>
